# genetic_algorithm_phub_allocation

Attempting to solve the Uncapacitated Single Allocation p-Hub Lcoation Problem with flow dependent cost. Performance was measured on three benchmark datasets: CAB, TR and RGP with varying number of nodes and hubs. 
- Model 1 implements a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach with crossover and mutation and a static termination criteria
- Model 2 implements GA with adaptive elitism and termination criteria and produces improved results in terms of solution quality and efficiency.
